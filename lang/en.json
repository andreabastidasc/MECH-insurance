        "item-one-question": "How does Original Medicare work?",
        "item-one-answer": "Original Medicare is a health insurance program that provides benefits to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who are 65 years of age or older, or who have a qualifying disability or illness.

        "item-three-answer": "Every year, there is an open enrollment period for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D.

This window extends from January 1st to March 31st, with coverage starting on July 1st. Before or after the open enrollment, you can enroll if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). If you are looking for more options or want to change your coverage, let us know.",

        "item-four-answer": "If you have lower income and have difficulty paying for your Part B, deductibles, coinsurance, or prescriptions, the Extra Help Program or the Medicare Savings Program can help make your healthcare costs more affordable than they would be with Medicare and Medicare Part D alone. <br> Your income and resources determine the level of assistance you receive. Generally, eligible beneficiaries for Extra Help in 2018 will not pay more than $3.35 for generic prescription drugs and $8.35 for brand-name drugs. Eligibility is based on annual income.

Additionally, there are special enrollment periods at any time of the year if you meet the requirements for established qualifying events.",
        "item-six-question": "Is Medicare the same as Medicaid?",
